## 🙋‍♂️ About me, in a limerick:

Full stack skills, with DevOps in tow,  
English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, and Japanese 🇯🇵 I know.  
It's learning I seek 🔍,  
Onwards to the peak 🏔️,  
Future projects will blossom 🌸, fo' sho'.

## 🟢 Tools I can be trusted with:

- TypeScript, React, Node.js, Jest, Cypress, Vite, CSS
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, REST
- Git, GitHub, Docker, CI/CD, Linux

## 🔴 Tools I cannot:

- Chainsaw
- Fishing rod
- Tractor

## 💭 My ethe\*:

\*The plural of ethos, apparently - always learning 😎

- 📚 Continuous learning, academic or otherwise
- 🌍 Working hollistically across domains to find solutions
- 💪 Simple, sleeves-rolled-up kind of effort and perseverance

## 🎨 Outside of tech I enjoy:

- 🗣️ Natural languages
- 🏃‍♂️ Running and calisthenics
- ❄️ Cold baths
- 📚 Reading non-fiction (tech and philosophy mainly, at the risk of sounding pretentious 😅)

**Non tech-related goal:** 🤸‍♂️ freestanding handstand pushup (_then_ I will be cool!)

## 🛠️ Currently working on:

Another Full Stack demo project to showcase the other half of my skillset, namely a SQL database and Redux state management. Gonna be pretty sweet. 😎

## 🕵️‍♂️ What I'm looking for:

- A Full Stack position where I can contribute my skills and learn new tools and technologies like DevOps, Cloud, weaving if need be!
- Open Source opportunities to help the community to continue providing the tools we all use.
- I genuinely enjoy learning, so anything that gives me an excuse to get stuck into some new docs, I'm looking for!

## 🤔 Some (debatably) interesting things:

- 🈵 I can read and write 2200 Japanese characters. 大変だったな〜
- 🧪 I once wrote around 6000 lines of testing code for a [project](https://github.com/Thomas-J-A/FakeMates/tree/main) where I first learnt about testing. To this day they give me faith in that API! 😍

## 📫 Contact me:

**Note:** I do not currently respond to postcards.

I'd love an email sent to [tomaspbury@icloud.com](mailto:tomaspbury@icloud.com) 🥲

## 📜 Finally, I leave you with this wonderful adage:

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic">The <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> way to do great work, is to love what you do.</p>
