## 🙋‍♂️ About me, in a limerick:

Full stack skills, with DevOps in tow,  
English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇪🇸, and Japanese 🇯🇵 I know.  
It's learning I seek 🔍,  
Onwards to the peak 🏔️,  
Future projects will blossom 🌸, fo' sho'.

## 🟢 Tools I can be trusted with:

- TypeScript, React, Node.js, Jest, Cypress, Vite, CSS
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, REST
- Git, GitHub, Docker, CI/CD, Linux

## 🔴 Tools I cannot:

- Chainsaw
- Fishing rod
- Tractor

## 💭 My ethe\*:

\*The plural of ethos, apparently - always learning 😎

- 📚 Continuous learning, academic or otherwise
- 🌍 Working hollistically across domains to find solutions
- 💪 Simple, sleeves-rolled-up kind of effort and perseverance

## 🎨 Outside of tech I enjoy:

- 🗣️ Natural languages
- 🏃‍♂️ Running and calisthenics
- ❄️ Cold baths
- 📚 Reading non-fiction (tech and philosophy mainly, at the risk of sounding pretentious 😅)

**Non tech-related goal:** 🤸‍♂️ freestanding handstand pushup (_then_ I will be cool!)

## 🛠️ Currently working on:

A language learning app which will help non-native English speakers better understand how to use the parts of speech (nouns, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc). It will be whimsical and engaging. I plan to showcase more of my skillset by using a PostgreSQL database, Redux, internationalization, and natural language processing. 😎

## 🕵️‍♂️ What I'm looking for:

- A Full Stack position where I can contribute my skills and learn new tools and technologies like DevOps, Cloud, weaving if need be!
- Open Source opportunities to help the community to continue providing the tools we all use.
- CompTIA and AWS certification to become more well-rounded (and a troubleshooting genius).
- I genuinely enjoy learning, so anything that gives me an excuse to get stuck into some new docs, I'm looking for!

## 🤔 Some (debatably) interesting things:

- 🈵 I can read and write 2200 Japanese characters. 大変だったな〜
- 🐑 My favourite animal is either a sheep, a mole, or a toad (still haven't decided).
- 😱 Incredible bonus fact: 一回狸を見たことがあります。

## 📫 Contact me:

**Note:** I do not currently respond to postcards.

I'd love an email sent to [tomaspbury@icloud.com](mailto:tomaspbury@icloud.com) 🥲

## 📜 Finally, I leave you with this wonderful adage:
